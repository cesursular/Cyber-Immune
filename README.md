# Cyber-Immune

A next-generation adaptive cybersecurity framework prototype.

## Vision
- AI-based anomaly detection
- Future integration with blockchain-based trust scoring
- Potential use of quantum-resistant cryptography

## Current Focus (MVP)
- Implement a basic anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest) on sample log data
- Create a simple API endpoint to query the model
- Lay the groundwork for future enhancements

## How to Contribute
- Clone the repository
- Make changes on a new branch
- Submit a Pull Request

## Roadmap
- [x] Set up project structure
- [ ] Add anomaly detection model
- [ ] Integrate simple FastAPI endpoint
- [ ] Add tests and improve documentation
